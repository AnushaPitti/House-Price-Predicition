In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict house prices using data from Ames, Iowa. 
I cleaned and engineered features from 79 variables and trained models like Linear Regression and XGBoost, with XGBoost performing best. 
I also analyzed key factors like location, size, and condition to provide actionable insights for buyers. 
This project strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, model optimization, and real-world decision-making.
